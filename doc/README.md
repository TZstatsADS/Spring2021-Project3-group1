# Project: Can you recognize the emotion from an image of a face?

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report file including the baseline(GBM) and the most advanced(randomforest) model, and rmd/pdf files including results from the obsolete advanced models.   

We have two types of dataset to be studied, imbalanced dataset(original one) and balanced dataset(smote one).

All of the models are built with the best parameter by pruning and cross-validation processe based on splited training data. 

Details of training and testing processes can be found in .R files for the corresponding model in lib folder.
