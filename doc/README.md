# Project: Can you recognize the emotion from an image of a face?

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

For each model, we have pruning and cross-validation process to choose the best parameter, and then trian and test the model with the best parameter.
Also, for each model, we have done the process decribed above for unweighted data and weighted data respectively.

The main.rmd and main.pdf contains only the baseline model and the randomforest model.
The detail for other models is included in the rmd file and pdf file named after the models.
